hi! this is my first real coding project: a chrome extension called Moku-Noru.
the title is a wordplay on one of my favorite things (bonus points if you can guess it!!)  

this project is a calming productivity tool built for brains that get overwhelmed easily‚Äîdesigned especially with my own ADHD in mind. everything here is meant to be visually soft, minimal, and functional without friction.

### key features so far:
- **pomodoro timer** (25 min work sessions + 5 min breaks)  
- **break mode** for short reset rituals  
- **to-do list** with categories: ‚Äútoday‚Äù and ‚Äúlater‚Äù  
- **trash bin** (undeletes for 7 days before clearing automatically)  
- **custom styling** in forest green and baby pink pastels
- **little pet** cute tiny pet to cheer you on

more additions in the works! stay tuned üçµ
