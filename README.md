hi! this is my first real coding project: a chrome extension called Moku-Noru. The title is a wordplay on one of my favorite things (bonus points if you can figure it out!!)
This project is meant to be a helpful and calming study/productivity extension and the features reflect tools that I use to keep me focused. 
I designed this with my own ADHD in mind, so everything is meant to be straightforward, visually calming, and made to reduce overwhelm. 

Here are some of the key features so far:
-pomodoro timer (25 min work sessions with a 5 min break)
-distraction silencer (mutes tabs like youtube, slack, outlook)
-break mode
-custom styling (uses pastels like forest green and baby pink)
